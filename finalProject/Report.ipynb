    "    Starting a new business for each investor may seem hard at first. One reason behind this is the risk associated with the dicision the investor makes. A significant portion of this risk is usually raised because the investor thinks no matter what business he starts, he will be outcompeted by those who are already experienced in that business. This concern can be overcomed if the investor finds out that for a special business the demand is more than the supply. In this project we assume there is an investor in China who is willing to open a food store, if we can convince him that he wont be outcompeted by other businesses around. \n",
